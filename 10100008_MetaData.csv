2,"Effective March 2, 2017, the Bank of Canada has changed the number, frequency and calculation methodology of its published foreign exchange (FX) rates. As a result, CANSIM table 176-0067 has been archived. A new CANSIM table (176-0080), ""Daily average foreign exchange rates in Canadian dollars, Bank of Canada,"" will display the daily averages of foreign currency exchange rates and Canadian-Dollar Effective Exchange Rate Index (CERI). ( http://www.bankofcanada.ca/2016/12/bank-canada-announces-details-forthcoming-changes/ )"
3,"Effective March 2, 2017, the Canadian-Dollar Effective Exchange Rate Index (CERI) (V41589522) will be moved to CANSIM table 176-0080 as V111666250, as a result of the changes to the exchange rates. The pre-March 2017 CERI data will not be revised to reflect the new methodology."
